MissingOutputException in rule raw_barseq in file /Users/vpandey/projects/githubs/Fertility_screen_final/Fertility_screen/Snakefile, line 44:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
{params.output_dir}
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
