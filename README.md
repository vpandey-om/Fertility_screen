Barseq experiment was done in 7 pools from pool1 to pool7. We have pool5 and pool7 was done two times. For combining all pools from pool1 to pool7 one could use script form codes ‘combine_all_pool.py’.

Scripts from the location ‘analysisCodes/scripts’ are used to plot figures in papers.


1)	For plotting ordered relative fertility error one could use script ‘plot_s_curve.py’ which is in folder: analysisCodes/scripts.
2)	MPMP pathway enrichment analysis was done by using the script: mpmp_enrichment.py form the folder: ‘analysisCodes/scripts’  
3)	 Comparison of fertility screen data with different screens we used (violin plots are generated) scripts: ‘violin_and_proteomics.py’ and ‘phospho_proteome.py’
4)	 combined error analysis to see noise in data we used script ‘error_combine_analysis.py’
